# Implementations
This is a bunch of implementation templates for Neil in Lua based engines

# Licenses
For licenses check the files per package. Mostly the frameworks themselves are zlib licensed, but some smaller sample files can be public domain.


# More engines
I am always game to have more engines covered... The more the merrier. Since I can never fully cover that all myself. Just create a pull request so I can review and merge it.
